## Captain’s Log — December 14, 2025

- **State of mind:** Real, happy, serious in what I do.  
- **Reflection:** I’ve never fit the typical norm, and that’s okay. My path is different, and I honor it.  
- **Artifact created:** First digital Space Car repo with schematics, BOM, and mission sequences.  
- **Lesson:** Even when dismissed or shut down, persistence turns imagination into lineage‑safe artifacts.  
- **Seal inscribed:** Seal of Being Real 1.0 — affirming joy and seriousness as the true measure of progress.
