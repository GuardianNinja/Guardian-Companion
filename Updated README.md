# Guardian Companion Spectrum Protocol 1.0

A lineage‑safe, non‑weaponized AI companion framework (Dog, Cat, Panther, Goldfish) with Guardian Mode, firewall overlay, device integration stubs, and lifecycle simulations — built to test equipment without collecting personal data.

## Design Principles
- Safety‑first guardianship: presence, observation, comfort; no aggression, no weaponization.
- Local‑only, opt‑in auth: hashed tokens and capability keys; no PII, no cloud sync by default.
- Clear parental alerts when a child activates Guardian Mode alone.
- Firewall overlay: blocks unauthorized traffic, filters harmful inputs, validates commands.
- Accessibility‑focused device integration (stubs): voice, gesture, tactile interfaces.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm start
